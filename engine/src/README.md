# Engine

## What the engine is

The engine is where all the code is stored that is usable for most types of games. For example: the renderer, audio systems, mouse pointer, etc.

## What the engine is not

The engine is not a place to store code that is hyper specific to a game. For example: a system for collecting coins.

## What if my system is specific to a particular genre?

You can make a seperate folder or package outside of the engine.
