 - [Elaborate] JS to TS on server side stuff
 - [Elaborate] Error: Request to create new app version must contain at least one actor
   - Happens when there are build errors or file import errors.
 - Consider adding `allowImportingTsExtensions` to the devvit tsconfig
 - [Elaborate(redis seeding example)] Ask AI was not useful, and infact it was actively harmful to my development
 - I have pi-hole + brave, so trackers are blocked, I also have extentions like password managers, etc. that log to the console. The console can be quite noisy.Consider adding a default logger that has some structured logs  e.g. using the name of the app as a prefix, allows me to understand what is and isn't from my app in the console. 
 - add server folder to tsconfig in templates
 - need a useMemo hook
 - web view init message + default for testing outside of devvit
