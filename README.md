# Lexicon

Welcome to **Lexicon**! A daily competitive word puzzle game where players test their linguistic skills to climb the leaderboard. 

## Rules
1. Gain points by forming valid words from the letters on the board.
2. Start by clicking on the first letter of the word you want to spell, then drag to any adjacent tile (including diagonally) to spell the word. 
3. Submitting a word by using the same tiles again will net you zero points. However if you can spell the same work using a different combination of tiles, you can score multiple times!
4. Words must be 3 letters or longer.
5. The longer your word, and the more uncommon the letters, the more points you will socre.
6. There is no penalty for submitting an incorrect word, to if you're unsure if a word is valid, try it anyway!
